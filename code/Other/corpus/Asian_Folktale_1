An old beggar passed through an old village. He knocked on the door of a big beautiful house, with a tall barn and a large iron padlock on the gate. In this house lived a man, known in the village for his miserliness : he never helped people, even though he was very rich.
 'Please give me some meat or milk?' - asked the beggar.
 The miser replied roughly:
 'No, I can't! Go away!'
 'Maybe you can give me some wheat or beans?' - kept asking the beggar, forced by hunger to humiliate himself. 
 'I don't have anything!' - said the miser.
 'Then give me a piece of bread, and I will be grateful.' - said the beggar.
 'Go away, I don't have bread!' - was the miser's reply.
 'At least give me some water? I'm very thirsty!'
 'I don't have water.' - screamed the miser.
 Then said the beggar :
 'Oh, my son, why are you sitting here then? Stand up and start begging food from the good people. You are even poorer than I am!
