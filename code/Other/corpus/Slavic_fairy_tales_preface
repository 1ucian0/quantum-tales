NOTE BY THE PUBLISHER
Very few of the twenty fairy tales included in this volume have been presented before in an English dress; this will doubtless enhance their value in the eyes of the young folk, for whom, principally, they are intended. It is hoped that older readers will find some additional interest in tracing throughout the many evidences of kinship between these stories and those of more pronounced Eastern origin.
The translation has been carefully revised by a well-known writer, who has interfered as little as possible with the original text, except in those instances where slight alterations were necessary.
The illustrations speak for themselves, and are what might have been expected from the artist who designed those for the “Lullabies of Many Lands,” issued last Christmas.
November 1895.
